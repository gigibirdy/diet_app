## Getting Started

 To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the project root direction.

 1. Install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

 ```
 npm install

 ```

 2. Skip this step if you have installed the Polymer CLI. Dependencies were imported by their npm package names. Since web browsers need to know a fileâ€™s full URL to import it, the development server included in Polymer CLI converts module names to paths.

 ```
 npm install -g polymer-cli

 ```

 3. Start local development server

 ```
 polymer serve

 ```

 4. Browse to the application URL.
